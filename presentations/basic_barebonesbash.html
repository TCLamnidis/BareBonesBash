in Bash ALWAYS MIND THE $. Only copy after the $ so you dont paste the command prompt too. $ is also important when dealing with variables, which you will see later today.

---

# Navigating the maze

As we mentioned, _~_ is your _home directory_. But where _is_ your home?

```bash
pwd
```
--
This prints the entire "filepath" of the directory i.e. the route from the "root" 
(a specific directory on the machine), through every subdirectory, leading to your 
particular folder. 

```
/home/thiseas
```

# Let's talk about paths!
.cols[
.sixty[
While walking around downtown Jena, you feel a rumble in your belly, and feel a craving that only a _currywurst with sweet potato fries_ can fulfill. 

You look around and see a stranger sitting under __the statue of Kurfürst Johann Friedrich.__ You approach the stranger and ask them for directions to Fritz Mitte!]

# Absolute paths
.cols[
.sixty[
The location of a file or folder, __from the “root” directory__ (/).


Equivalent to getting directions to Fritz Mitte, from Jentower (the de facto landmark in Jena).


>___“From Jentower, cross Leutragraben and turn right. You will see FM 100m ahead!”___
<p align="right"><i>Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

--

__Absolute__ paths always start with `/`. Paths starting with `~` are also absolute paths, since `~` translates to the absolute path of your specific home directory. That is the directory path you see in the output of the `pwd` command you just ran.

These directions are true no matter where in town you happen to be.

# Relative paths
.cols[
.sixty[
The location of a file or folder, __from your current directory.__

Equivalent getting directions to Fritz Mitte from your current location.

>___“Go down that road, turn left, then keep going straight until you see it!”___
<p align="right"><i>also Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

__Relative__ paths are always relative to your working directory (i.e.
  your current directory). Often this type of path will begin with one (`./`) 
  or two (`../`) dots followed by a forward slash. 
  
__NOTE:__ In the syntax of relative paths `.` means "the current directory" and `..` means "the parent directory" (or the 'one above').

These directions are easier to follow, but only work if you begin AT MARKTPLATZ.

# Downloading files with `wget`

We are going to download a FASTQ file from the ENA (European Nucleotide Archive). This should be pretty quick!

> For non-squishy dead thing nerds: a FASTQ file is just a text file with DNA molecule sequences and extra metadata]


<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/mario-kart-lAIbbDbcXSZSU" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lAIbbDbcXSZSU/giphy.gif" width="20%">

--

```bash
## Download!
wget ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR202/001/ERR2020601/ERR2020601.fastq.gz

## if you don't have wget, you can instead use 'curl' with the command below.
# curl -O ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR202/001/ERR2020601/ERR2020601.fastq.gz

## Then to check if the file is now in our working directory
ls

```

---

# Organise yo' stuff!

Use `mv` as it should be used, and move your newly downloaded file into your workshop folder.

Then check to see if it moved!

--

```bash
mv ~/ERR2020601.fastq.gz ~/BareBonesBash
ls
```

--

You should now see that the fastq file is no longer in your home folder.

---

# But where did it go?!

Lets see if it went to were we told it to go...

--

```bash
cd ~/BareBonesBash
ls 
```

Good, the file arrived in `~/BareBonesBash/` safely!  But what is in it?

In bash, you can normally use 
`cat` with text files, short for con**cat**enate, which is used to print the 
contents of a file to the screen. Lets try this with our newly downloaded file.

# Oh...

- You probably had a bunch of junk printed to screen or nothing displayed 
  - just press enter to cancel

- That's because the FASTQ file, as with almost all FASTQs, is compressed 
  - as indicated by the .gz

## Viewing the gz

To view the _human readable_ contents of the file, we 
can instead use `zcat`. Don't forget your auto-complete!

--

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz

```

--

```
@ERR2020601.147099 F_AHSTEUER006:166:C5UJMANXX:8:2109:2222:68258/1

That looks much better, we can now actually see some DNA sequences!

# The Lord of the Pipes: One command to do them all.

# Ceci n'est pas une pipe

After that tangent, let's get back to our regularly scheduled program(ming)!

--

Now we will get familiar with the most important functionality of bash: the
concept of the `|` (a.k.a the "pipe")

# Pass the parcel

- A pipe passes the output of one command and gives it as input to the next. 
- It allows us to string multiple commands together, one after the other, 
  - which means you can do more complicated (and beautiful) things to your files "on the fly". 

--

Lets try this out with new new commands

.cols[
.fifty[
- `head` 
  - shows first 10 lines of a file
- `tail` 
  - shows the last 10 lines. 
]
.fifty[

</p>
]
]

---

# Tiene cabeza...

We will now print the file to screen with `zcat`, but rather than just let 
the whole thing print, we will "pipe" the output into `head`, which will 
allow us to see just the first 10 lines.

```bash
zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head

```
--

We can also display more lines with the `-n` flag (short for "**n**umber of 
lines"). To see the first 20 lines you would use 

```bash
zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head -n 20

```

---

# ...y tiene cola

The same option exists for tail, note that but options are not universal! Not 
every programme will use the same options!

```bash
zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | tail -n 4

```

--

And you can also chain them altogether _\[not unlike a human centipede... No 
gif here so we don't get fired]_

--

```bash
zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head -n 20 | tail -n 4
```

The above command will print the whole file, but capture only the first 20 
lines, before printing out the last 4 lines of these 20.

<p align="center"><img title="Made with EZGif.com" src="../docs/.gifs/frodo.gif" width="30%" height="20%"></p>

---

# Slow down dude...

But what if you wanted to view the whole file "at your own leisurely pace"

<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/stroll-82abB3W2DknkY" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/82abB3W2DknkY/giphy.gif" width="20%">
</p>

We can use the tool `less`, which prints the file to screen, but allows you 
to move up and down the output with your `arrow keys`. You can also move down 
a full screen with the `spacebar`.

```bash
zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | less

```

To quit the viwer: press "q" on your keyboard.
---


# Hold your horses... what does all this junk mean!?

In practice, what was just printed on your screen is the record of a single DNA 
molecule, which spans 4 lines of the FASTQ file. 

* The record begins with the read ID, preceded by an `@`, given by the sequencing machine
* The next line contains the actual DNA sequence of the read. 
* The third line is a separator line ('`+`'). 
* Finally, the fourth line of this record contains the base quality score for each position on the read, encoded a certain way.  (again something the sequencer)


# lol wut?

Don't worry if this makes no sense...

--

The important thing is that there is a repeated structure in the file (in this 
case a collection of lines with the same structure for each DNA molecule)


Why does this matter?
