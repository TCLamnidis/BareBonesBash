in Bash ALWAYS MIND THE $. Only copy after the $ so you dont paste the command prompt too. $ is also important when dealing with variables, which you will see later today.

---

# Navigating the maze

As we mentioned, _~_ is your _home directory_. But where _is_ your home?

```bash
$ pwd
```
--
This prints the entire "filepath" of the directory i.e. the route from the "root" 
(a specific directory on the machine), through every subdirectory, leading to your 
particular folder. 

```
/home/thiseas
```

# Let's talk about paths!

While walking around downtown Jena, you feel a rumble in your belly, and feel a craving that only a _currywurst with sweet potato fries_ can fulfill. 

You look around and see a stranger sitting under __the statue of Kurfürst Johann Friedrich.__ You approach the stranger and ask them for directions to Fritz Mitte!]

# Absolute paths
.cols[

The location of a file or folder, __from the “root” directory__ (/).


Equivalent to getting directions to Fritz Mitte, from Jentower (the de facto landmark in Jena).


>___“From Jentower, cross Leutragraben and turn right. You will see FM 100m ahead!”___
<p align="right"><i>Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

--

__Absolute__ paths always start with `/`. Paths starting with `~` are also absolute paths, since `~` translates to the absolute path of your specific home directory. That is the directory path you see in the output of the `pwd` command you just ran.

These directions are true no matter where in town you happen to be.

# Relative paths
.cols[
.sixty[
The location of a file or folder, __from your current directory.__

Equivalent getting directions to Fritz Mitte from your current location.

>___“Go down that road, turn left, then keep going straight until you see it!”___
<p align="right"><i>also Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

__Relative__ paths are always relative to your working directory (i.e.
  your current directory). Often this type of path will begin with one (`./`) 
  or two (`../`) dots followed by a forward slash. 
  
__NOTE:__ In the syntax of relative paths `.` means "the current directory" and `..` means "the parent directory" (or the 'one above').

???
These directions are easier to follow, but only work if you begin AT MARKTPLATZ.

---

# The contents of a directory

Now let's look around at our current location and see what we can find within 
our home directory. We can use the command `ls`, shorthand for "list", which 
will (surprise surprise) list the directory contents.

```bash
$ ls

```
--
This will produce no output, since your current directory is empty. Let's change that!
--
<br>
You can make a new empty directory using the command `mkdir`, shorthand for 
"**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory".

```bash
$ mkdir ~/BareBonesBosh
$ ls ~
```

--
```
BareBonesBosh
```
Now that your home directory is not empty, `ls` has output!

---

# Directory Management

It is important to keep your corner of the computer well organised, and the 
trick to doing that is making your own directories. Often _a lot_ of them. 
--
<br><br>
__But what's this!?! There was a typo in the name of the directory you made!__
<p align="center"><img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/table-flip-ieGdB2g5kDIkg" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ieGdB2g5kDIkg/giphy.gif" width="25%"> <img title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/it-crowd-moss-computer-throw-gif-5404468" src="https://media.tenor.co/images/d82c7edc4b04227b4c973f24b904695f/raw" width="32%"></p>

--
But don't lose hope, as we can rename things with the `mv` command, 
shorthand for "**m**o**v**e". 

In fact move, as the name suggests, will move a file/folder into a new location, 
also renaming it in the process if necessary. It works by typing `mv`, the old 
location and a target location.

```bash
$ mv ~/BareBonesBosh ~/BearBonesBash

```

---

# Oh no! Not again! 
```bash
$ ls
```
```
BearBonesBash
```
This is not a bash tutorial for ancient __bear__ genomics!
<p align="center"><img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/bear-forest-water-IQ9KefLJHfJPq" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/IQ9KefLJHfJPq/giphy.gif" width="20%"></p>
--
Let's just delete that empty directory and start over, using the `rmdir` 
command, short for "**r**e**m**ove **dir**ectory".

```bash
$ rmdir ~/BearBonesBash
```
--

And now we can create our directory, properly named this time.

```bash
$ mkdir ~/BareBonesBash
$ ls
```
```
BareBonesBash
```

---

# Navigating the file system
Now that we have our directory, we should move into it. To do this, we will need to use `cd`, short for __c__hange __d__irectory.

```bash
$ cd BareBonesBash
```
--
You can see that your current directory has changed on your command prompt! (or you can use `pwd`). <br>
--
To move to the parent directory of your current location, you can use:
```bash
cd ..
```
--
You can also use an abosolute path to move to a directory:
```bash
cd ~/BareBonesBash
```
--
> **BONUS TIP TIME!** When 
using `cd` you can use a dash (`-`) to indicate 'my previous location'. This is 
useful since you can traverse _[ha! I have my own fancy words now! - James]_ 
multiple directories with one `cd` command.

---

# Concept: Comments
Try running the following code:
```bash
## Remember in "A land before time" when the dinosaur's mother died?
```
--
While reading that command, you 
might have been reminded of one of the most emotionally devastating moments of 
any person's life. <p align="center"><img title="Source: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/sad-before-time?utm_term=.cjY4banJZ#.ixJ815NjJ" src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-04/29/21/enhanced/webdr15/anigif_enhanced-31175-1430357953-19.gif" width="35%"></p>
--
<br>However, the computer would show no signs of emotional 
struggle whatsoever, because it __ignores 
anything that comes after a _comment character_, which in bash is a hash (`#`).__
???
You can use comments to explain what a certain bit of code 
does, without affecting how that code runs. This can also be a useful lifehack 
in certain situations, an example of which will be given later.

# Downloading files with `wget`

We are going to download a FASTQ file from the ENA (European Nucleotide Archive). This should be pretty quick!

```bash
## Download!
$ wget ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR202/001/ERR2020601/ERR2020601.fastq.gz

## if you don't have wget, you can instead use 'curl' with the command below.
#$ curl -O ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR202/001/ERR2020601/ERR2020601.fastq.gz

## Then to check if the file is now in our working directory
$ ls

```

---

# Organise yo' stuff!

Use `mv` as it should be used, and move your newly downloaded file into your workshop folder.

Then check to see if it moved!

--

```bash
$ mv ~/ERR2020601.fastq.gz ~/BareBonesBash
$ ls
```

--

You should now see that the fastq file is no longer in your home folder.

---

# But where did it go?!

Lets see if it went to were we told it to go...

--

```bash
$ cd ~/BareBonesBash
$ ls 
```

Good, the file arrived in `~/BareBonesBash/` safely!  But what is in it?

### Piping

---

# Ceci n'est pas une pipe

After that tangent, let's get back to our regularly scheduled program(ming)!

--

Now we will get familiar with the most important functionality of bash: the
concept of the `|` (a.k.a the "pipe")

<p align="center">

<p align="center">

</p>

---

# Pass the parcel

- A pipe passes the output of one command and gives it as input to the next. 
- It allows us to string multiple commands together, one after the other, 
  - which means you can do more complicated (and beautiful) things to your files "on the fly". 

--

Lets try this out with new new commands

.left-column[
- `head` 
  - shows first 10 lines of a file
- `tail` 
  - shows the last 10 lines. 
]
.right-column[

<p align="center">
<iframe align="center" src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MeekWarpedAsiandamselfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen></iframe> 
</p>
]


---

# Tiene cabeza...

We will now print the file to screen with `zcat`, but rather than just let 
the whole thing print, we will "pipe" the output into `head`, which will 
allow us to see just the first 10 lines.

> Don't forget your auto-complete with the tab key!

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head

```

--

We can also display more lines with the `-n` flag (short for "**n**umber of 
lines"). To see the first 20 lines you would use 

> **Bonus tip time** you can press up and down on your keyboard buttons to
view previous commands!

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head -n 20

```

---

# ...y tiene cola

The same option exists for tail, note that but options are not universal! Not 
every programme will use the same options!

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | tail -n 4

```

--

And you can also chain them altogether _\[not unlike a human centipede... No 
gif here so we don't get fired]_

--

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head -n 20 | tail -n 4
```

The above command will print the whole file, but capture only the first 20 
lines, before printing out the last 4 lines of these 20.

<p align="center"><img title="Made with EZGif.com" src="../docs/.gifs/frodo.gif" width="30%" height="20%"></p>

---

# Slow down dude...

But what if you wanted to view the whole file "at your own leisurely pace"

<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/stroll-82abB3W2DknkY" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/82abB3W2DknkY/giphy.gif" width="20%">
</p>

We can use the tool `less`, which prints the file to screen, but allows you 
to move up and down the output with your `arrow keys`. You can also move down 
a full screen with the `spacebar`.

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | less

```

To quit the viwer: press "q" on your keyboard.

# Hold your horses... what does all this junk mean!?

In practice, what was just printed on your screen is the record of a single DNA 
molecule, which spans 4 lines of the FASTQ file. 

--

* The record begins with the read ID, preceded by an `@`, given by the sequencing machine

--

* The next line contains the actual DNA sequence of the read. 

--

* The third line is a separator line ('`+`'). 

--

* Finally, the fourth line of this record contains the base quality score for each position on the read, encoded a certain way.  (again something the sequencer)

---

# lol wut?

Don't worry if this makes no sense...

--

The important thing is that there is a repeated structure in the file (in this 
case a collection of lines with the same structure for each DNA molecule)


Why does this matter?

<p align="center"><b>What is a common PATTERN in the file?</b></p>


---

# But DNA molecules FASTQ have four lines!

> * The record begins with the read ID, preceded by an `@`, given by the sequencing machine

--

Lets count each line with a `@` in it!

# Grep

To search for a particular character or string in a text file we can use 

`grep`


This prints only lines in a file that match a certain pattern.

--

For example

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | grep @

```

Results in...

-- 

```
@ERR2020601.147096 F_AHSTEUER006:166:C5UJMANXX:8:1215:14390:82061/1
AB@BBGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEFGGGGGGGGGGGGGFGGGGG>GGGGGGGGGGAFGGGGGGGGGGGG
@ERR2020601.147097 F_AHSTEUER006:166:C5UJMANXX:8:1301:14633:50792/1
@ERR2020601.147098 F_AHSTEUER006:166:C5UJMANXX:8:1210:12875:93069/1
@ERR2020601.147099 F_AHSTEUER006:166:C5UJMANXX:8:2109:2222:68258/1
@ERR2020601.147100 F_AHSTEUER006:166:C5UJMANXX:8:1315:17303:82366/1
3B=@BECGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
```

# Close but no cigar...

Unfortunately we seem to have picked up some other stuff because of the @ 
characters in the sequence quality lines. 

--

We can therefore use a more specific _string_ to ensure we print stuff want.

--

In this case, each read ID begins with '@ERR'

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | grep @ERR | less
```

--

Scroll up and down - this looks better, doesn't it?!

> Remember to press your q key to quit `less`!

---

## ding ding ding - Round TWO!

Lets now try and count the number of read IDs, to find the number of DNA 
molecules in our file

```zcat
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | grep @ERR | wc -l

```
--
```
4720

</p>

Lets get 7 more!

--

But typing the same `wget` command over and over isn't being lazy!

--

Instead, we can supply `wget` a text file, with the link to each new FASTQ file.

```bash
$ wget -i <LIST_OF_URLS>.txt
```

# Text editing

.left-column[
But how can we make this file?

</p>

]

--

.left-column[
If you're absolutely insane you may look up `vim` 
_\[Thiseas' poison\]_, or we can use `nano` which is much more user friendly.
]

--

.left-column[
- `nano` is a text editor
  - Similar to `TextMate`, `gedit` or `notepad`
  - But runs in your terminal
  - Main difference: how you 'save', 'close' etc.
  - These are controlled with special key combinations 
      - e.g. ctrl + c to copy text in word
]

---

# Lets do eet!

So open up the program with

```bash
$ nano
```
--

- Try typing something!
- Look at the bottom of the window
  - These correspond to different commands (save, exit, etc.)
  - `^` corresponds to your `ctrl` or `cmd` keys on your keyboard
- Move around with your arrow keys.

--

- To save the contents of your file
  1. Initiate exit with `ctrl + x`
  2. You will be prompted to 'Save modified buffer'.
  3. Press `y` on your keyboard to agree
  4. Set the file name as `~/BareBonesBash/Ftp.Link.txt`
  5. Press `enter` to save

All done!

---

# Not ANOTHER typo!?

We can check that the file was successfully generated by navigating into 
the directory and doing `ls`.

```bash
$ cd ~/BareBonesBash/
ls

```
--

Great! There is a file there! But wait! OH NO! There is another typo! We 
want to have multiple _links_ not a Link!

<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/the-legend-of-zelda-link-funny-RkymcOKhoCRTG" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/RkymcOKhoCRTG/giphy.gif" width="45%">

</p>

Lets remove that file, and start again. 

---

## Delete...

.left-column[
So far, we learnt `rmdir` to remove a directory. 

To remove a file, we can instead use `rm` for – you guessed it! – **r**e**m**ove. 
]

.right-column[
<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/trash-desktop-delete-pHWPC1N5IZGVTfRgsN" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pHWPC1N5IZGVTfRgsN/giphy.gif">
</p>
]

.left-column[
```bash
$ rm Ftp.Link.txt
$ ls
```
And it's gone!
]

---

# Anyway...

Now we've fixed our typo 

1. Open `nano` again
2. Go to [https://tinyurl.com/BBB-FtpLinks](https://tinyurl.com/BBB-FtpLinks) in your \[_real life_\] internet browser
3. Copy the text on the webpage
4. \[_back down the rabbit hole_\] paste the text into `nano`

> Note the `#`, this means the line is **commented out** as we've already downloaded this file!

--

.left-column-66[
So again to recap exiting and save a file in nano we do the following dance: 
  1. Initiate exit with `ctrl + x`
  2. You will be prompted to 'Save modified buffer'.
  3. Press `y` on your keyboard to agree
  4. Set the file name as `~/BareBonesBash/Ftp.Link.txt`
  5. Press `enter` to save
