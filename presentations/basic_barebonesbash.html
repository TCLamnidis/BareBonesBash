What you see here is the "command prompt". username@server:pwd$
me, at the workshop server. ~ means "my HOME directory" (user specific).

#Always mind the $!

in Bash ALWAYS MIND THE $. Only copy after the $ so you dont paste the command prompt too. $ is also important when dealing with variables, which you will see later today.

# Navigating the maze

As we mentioned, _~_ is your _home directory_. But where _is_ your home?

```bash
pwd
```
--
This prints the entire "filepath" of the directory i.e. the route from the "root" 
(a specific directory on the machine), through every subdirectory, leading to your 
particular folder. 

```
/home/thiseas
```

# Let's talk about paths!
.cols[
.sixty[
While walking around downtown Jena, you feel a rumble in your belly, and feel a craving that only a _currywurst with sweet potato fries_ can fulfill. 

You look around and see a stranger sitting under __the statue of Kurfürst Johann Friedrich.__ You approach the stranger and ask them for directions to Fritz Mitte!]

# Absolute paths
.cols[
.sixty[
The location of a file or folder, __from the “root” directory__ (/).


Equivalent to getting directions to Fritz Mitte, from Jentower (the de facto landmark in Jena).


>___“From Jentower, cross Leutragraben and turn right. You will see FM 100m ahead!”___
<p align="right"><i>Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

__Absolute__ paths always start with `/`. Paths starting with `~` are also absolute paths, since `~` translates to the absolute path of your specific home directory. That is the directory path you see in the output of the `pwd` command you just ran.

These directions are true no matter where in town you happen to be.

# Relative paths
.cols[
.sixty[
The location of a file or folder, __from your current directory.__

Equivalent getting directions to Fritz Mitte from your current location.

>___“Go down that road, turn left, then keep going straight until you see it!”___
<p align="right"><i>also Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

__Relative__ paths are always relative to your working directory (i.e.
  your current directory). Often this type of path will begin with one (`./`) 
  or two (`../`) dots followed by a forward slash. 
  
__NOTE:__ In the syntax of relative paths `.` means "the current directory" and `..` means "the parent directory" (or the 'one above').

These directions are easier to follow, but only work if you begin AT MARKTPLATZ.
