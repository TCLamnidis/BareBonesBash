It's better to spend 1day working on a script that will save you 5min per day for the rest of your PhD, than putting in those 5 minutes!

TAB will be you favourite key by the time we are done here.

---

.right-column[
- 99% of the time, someone else has already had the same issue.
- Let the poor soul do the work for you!
- (...and pass it on!)
]
???
HOW to google programming questions is not as trivial as it sounds. In the final part of today's session we can talk a bit about this.

---

class: middle

# Rule Nr. 3

.left-column[
## Document everything you do.
]
.right-column[
- Makes future you happy
- Reproducibility
- Helps others!
]

---

class: middle

# Rule Nr. 4

.left-column[
## There will ALWAYS be a typo!
]
.right-column[
- Don't get disheartned, even best programmers make mistakes
- Sometimes the problem _isn't_ you being 'stupid', programmers are crap at documentation
]

---

class: middle

# Rule Nr. 5

.left-column[
## Don't be afraid of you freedom!

]

.right-column[
- Explore! Try out things! 
- It never works the first time. But it does work eventually!

# Into the hacker-verse

### You are about to use the terminal!

__A terminal is a window that allows you to access the command line interfce of a computer/server.__

--

i.e. a place for you to write to the computer what you want it to do.

--

----

__Bash is the programming language that is used within the Terminal.__

--

i.e. it is _how_ you tell the computer what you want it to do.

What you see here is the "command prompt". username@server:pwd$
me, at the workshop server. ~ means "my HOME directory" (user specific).

# Always mind the $!

<p align="center"><img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/studiosoriginals-gilphabet-3o84U72tKO389H2lI4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o84U72tKO389H2lI4/giphy.gif" ></p>

???
in Bash ALWAYS MIND THE $. Only copy after the $ so you dont paste the command prompt too. $ is also important when dealing with variables, which you will see later today.

---

# Navigating the maze

`pwd` stands for "__p__rint __w__rite __d__irectory" 
```bash
$ pwd
```
???
As we mentioned, _~_ is your _home directory_. But where _is_ your home?
--

```
/home/thiseas
```
???
This prints the entire "filepath" of the directory i.e. the route from the "root" 
(a specific directory on the machine), through every subdirectory, leading to your 
particular folder. 

Each user has their own home directory!

---

# Let's talk about paths!

.left-column-66[
While walking around downtown Jena, you feel a rumble in your belly, and feel a craving that only a _currywurst with sweet potato fries_ can fulfill. 

You look around and see a stranger sitting under __the statue of KurfÃ¼rst Johann Friedrich.__ You approach the stranger and ask them for directions to Fritz Mitte!]

# Absolute paths

.left-column-66[
The location of a file or folder, __from the ârootâ directory__ (`/`).

]

--

.left-column-66[

Equivalent to getting directions to Fritz Mitte, from Jentower (the de facto landmark in Jena).


>___âFrom Jentower, cross Leutragraben and turn right. You will see FM 100m ahead!â___
<p align="right"><i>Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>
]




???
These directions are true no matter where in town you happen to be.

--

.left-column-66[

__Example of an absolute path:__
```
/home/thiseas
```
]
???
__Absolute__ paths always start with `/`. Paths starting with `~` are also absolute paths, since `~` translates to the absolute path of your specific home directory. That is the directory path you see in the output of the `pwd` command you just ran.


---

# Relative paths

.left-column-66[
The location of a file or folder, __from your current directory.__
]

.right-column-33[
<p align="right">

--

.left-column-66[

Equivalent getting directions to Fritz Mitte from your current location.

>___âGo down that road, turn left, then keep going straight until you see it!â___
<p align="right"><i>also Kind stranger, 2019</i></p>

]

???
These directions are easier to follow, but only work if you begin AT MARKTPLATZ.

--

.left-column-66[
__Example of a relative path:__
```
../Documents/Memes/Pepe.png
```
]
???
__Relative__ paths are always relative to your working directory (i.e.
  your current directory). Often this type of path will begin with one (`./`) 
  or two (`../`) dots followed by a forward slash. 

In the syntax of relative paths `.` means "the current directory" and `..` means "the parent directory" (or the 'one above'). 

---

# The contents of a directory

`ls` is shorthand for **l**i**s**t. 

```bash
$ ls

```
???
Now let's look around at our current location and see what we can find within 
our home directory.

`ls` is shorthand for "list". It will (surprise surprise) list the contents of the current directory.

This will produce no output, since your current directory is empty. Let's change that!
--
<br><br>
`mkdir` is shorthand for "**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory".

```bash
$ mkdir ~/BBB
$ ls ~
```
???
You can make a new empty directory using the command `mkdir`, shorthand for 
"**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory".

--
```
BBB
```
Now that your home directory is not empty, `ls` has output!
???
Also notice that if we provide a path to `ls`, it will list the contents of the given directory.

---

# Directory Management

__However, `BBB` is not a very descriptive name.__

???
In two years when you start looking through these folders `BBB` won't mean much and you will likely go like this. (click)

--

<p align="center"><img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/table-flip-ieGdB2g5kDIkg" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ieGdB2g5kDIkg/giphy.gif" width="25%"> <img title="Source: https://tenor.com/view/it-crowd-moss-computer-throw-gif-5404468" src="https://media.tenor.co/images/d82c7edc4b04227b4c973f24b904695f/raw" width="32%"></p>

--

**Important:** keep your corner of the computer well organised!
- The trick: make own directories. 
- Often, _a lot_ of them. 

--

But don't lose hope, as we can rename things with the `mv` command, 
shorthand for "**m**o**v**e". 

```bash
$ mv ~/BBB BearBonesBash

```
???
In fact move, as the name suggests, will move a file/folder into a new location, 
also renaming it in the process if necessary. It works by typing `mv`, the old 
location and a target location.

__Can you tell me what type of path each argument to the command used is?__

---

# Oh no! Not again! 
```bash
$ ls
```
```
BearBonesBash
```

<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/bear-forest-water-IQ9KefLJHfJPq" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/IQ9KefLJHfJPq/giphy.gif" width="20%">
</p>
???
This is not a bash tutorial for ancient __bear__ genomics! Let's just delete that empty directory and start over.
--
`rmdir` is short for "**r**e**m**ove **dir**ectory"
???
__rmdir only works on EMPTY directories!__
--

```bash
$ rmdir ~/BearBonesBash
$ ls
```
???
Now your home directory is empty again.

---

# From the beginning...

<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://66.media.tumblr.com/f36d6c252af07ce3202ef9d73413e9c6/tumblr_mqm45nq9e01sqsny9o1_400.gif" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f36d6c252af07ce3202ef9d73413e9c6/tumblr_mqm45nq9e01sqsny9o1_400.gif" width="70%">
</p>

```bash
$ mkdir ~/BareBonesBash
$ ls
```
???
And now we can create our directory, properly named this time.

--
```
BareBonesBash
```
Much better!

---

# Navigating the file system
`cd` is short for "__c__hange __d__irectory".

```bash
$ cd BareBonesBash
```
???

Now that we have our directory, we should move into it. 
--
???
You can see that your current directory has changed on your command prompt! (or you can use `pwd`).
--
To move to the parent directory of your current location:
```bash
$ cd ..
```
--

```bash
$ cd ~/BareBonesBash
```
???
You can also use an abosolute path to move to a directory:
--

You can also use the shortcut `-` (hyphen) to indicate 'my previous location'. 

This is useful since you can traverse multiple directories with one `cd` command. Try it now!

```bash
cd -
```

---

# Concept: Comments

Try running the following code:
```bash
$ ## Remember in "A land before time" when the dinosaur's mother died?
```
???

While reading that command, you 
might have been reminded of one of the most emotionally devastating moments of 
any young person's life.
--
 <p align="center"><img title="Source: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bradesposito/sad-before-time?utm_term=.cjY4banJZ#.ixJ815NjJ" src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-04/29/21/enhanced/webdr15/anigif_enhanced-31175-1430357953-19.gif" width="35%"></p>
???
However, the computer would show no signs of emotional 
struggle whatsoever, because it __ignores anything that comes after a _comment character_, which in bash is a hash (`#`).__

???
--

## `#` is the comment character
???
If you are writing scripts for others to use, you should use comments to explain what a certain bit of code does. 
This is also a great way to ignore selected parts of code. 

Often this also works with input files, as you will see later.

---

class: center,middle
### To rehash:
##In bash, a hash (`#`) will stash your code in a flash!

# Downloading files with `wget`

$ ls

```
???
Notice how I have used comments to explain what the different sections of the code do!

---

# Organise yo' stuff!

Use `mv` as it should be used, and move your newly downloaded file into your workshop folder.

```bash
$ mv ~/ERR2020601.fastq.gz ~/BareBonesBash

Then check to see if it moved!

<br/>
- That's because the FASTQ file is _compressed_ 
  - As with almost all FASTQs 
  - Also most large text files
  - as indicated by the `.gz`


---

## Viewing the gz

To view the _human readable_ contents of the file, we 
can instead use `zcat`. Don't forget your auto-complete!

--

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz

```

## Yeah, but what EXACTLY is compression?

- Compression is a way of saving hard-disk space
  - finds common patterns and replace with a smaller (repeated)-value
  - later translated back (decompression)

GZIP(1)                     General Commands Manual                    GZIP(1)

NAME
       gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files

SYNOPSIS
       gzip [ -acdfhklLnNrtvV19 ] [--rsyncable] [-S suffix] [ name ...  ]
       gunzip [ -acfhklLnNrtvV ] [-S suffix] [ name ...  ]
       zcat [ -fhLV ] [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Gzip  reduces  the  size  of  the  named  files using Lempel-Ziv coding
       (LZ77).  Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced  by  one  with  the
       extension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modiâ
       fication times.  (The default extension is -gz for VMS,  z  for  MSDOS,
       OS/2  FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if
       a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed  to  the  standard
       output.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particuâ
       lar, it will ignore symbolic links.

```

- To navigate:
  - Scroll up and down with arrow keys
  - Quit press `q` on your keyboard

Scroll until you see `OPTIONS` - what does `--list` do?

---

# Oooooooh

The option `--list`/`-l` lists 
  - the size of a file in both compressed and uncompressed form
  -as well as the compression ratio (how effective the 
compression was). 

--

**Most programmes you will use DO have a `man` page, making this command 
extremely useful.**.

--

Lets try our new found knowledge!

```bash
$ gzip -l ERR2020601.fastq.gz

```
--
```
         compressed        uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name
             217232              864983  74.9% ERR2020601.fastq
```
<br/>

Not bad! Our file 25.1% the size of the uncompressed file would.

### Piping

---

# Ceci n'est pas une pipe

After that tangent, let's get back to our regularly scheduled program(ming)!



--

Now we will get familiar with the most important functionality of bash: 
  - the concept of .huge[`|`] (a.k.a the "pipe")

<p align="center">
  <img title="Made with EZGif.com" src="../docs/.gifs/Boromir.gif" > 
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img title="Source: https://tinynin.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/marioportal-warp-pipe/" src="https://tinynin.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/warppipe-copy.gif" width = "30%" >
</p>

---

# Pass the parcel

- A pipe passes the output of one command and gives it as input to the next. 

--

- It allows us to connect **multiple commands together**, 
  - One after the other 
  - Enables more complicated (and beautiful) actions on your files "on the fly". 

--

<br/>
<br/>

Lets try this out with new commands

.left-column[
- `head` 
  - shows first 10 lines of a file
- `tail` 
  - shows the last 10 lines. 
]
.right-column[

<p align="center">
<iframe align="center" src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/MeekWarpedAsiandamselfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen></iframe> 
</p>

---

# Tiene cabeza...

We will now print the file to screen with `zcat`
  - But pipe the output of`zcat` into `head`
  - This will stop the print vomit 

> Don't forget your auto-complete with the tab key!

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head

```

--

<br/>


We can also display more lines with the `-n` flag (short for "**n**umber of 
lines"). To see the first 20 lines you would use 

> **Bonus tip time** you can press up and down on your keyboard buttons to
view previous commands!

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head -n 20

```

---

# ...y tiene cola

The same option exists for tail, note that but options are not universal! Not 
every programme will use the same options!

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | tail -n 4

```

--

And you can also chain them altogether .small[_\[not unlike a human centipede!... No 
gif here so we don't get fired]_]

--

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head -n 20 | tail -n 4
```

The above command will print the whole file, but capture only the first 20 
lines, before printing out the last 4 lines of these 20.

<p align="center"><img title="Made with EZGif.com" src="../docs/.gifs/frodo.gif" width="30%" height="20%"></p>

# Slow down dude...

</p>

We can use the tool `less`, 
- Prints the file to screen in a controlled manner
- Move up and down the output (per lines) with your `arrow keys`. 
- Move up and down (per screen) with the `spacebar`.

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | less

```

To quit the viewer: press "q" on your keyboard.

# Hold your horses... what does all this junk mean!?

In practice, what was just printed on your screen is the record of a single DNA 
molecule, which spans 4 lines of the FASTQ file. 

--

* The record begins with the read ID, preceded by an `@`, given by the sequencing machine

--

* The next line contains the actual DNA sequence of the read. 

--

* The third line is a separator line ('`+`'). 

--

* Finally, the fourth line of this record contains the base quality score for each position on the read, encoded a certain way.  (again something the sequencer)

# Grep

To search for a particular character or string in a text file we can use 

`grep`


This prints only lines in a file that match a certain pattern.

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | grep @

```

Results in...

--

```

# Close but no cigar...

Unfortunately we seem to have picked up some other stuff because of the @ 
characters in the sequence quality lines. 

???
not every line starts with "@ERR", which means we also picked up lines that happen to have a @ in the sequence quality line

--

We can therefore use a more specific _string_ to ensure we print stuff want.

--

In this case, each read ID begins with '@ERR'

```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | grep @ERR | less
```

--

Scroll up and down - this looks better, doesn't it?!

> Remember to press your q key to quit `less`!

## ding ding ding - Round TWO!

molecules in our file

They are a great way to have a file or folder in two places at once without copying it over. 

---

# Making symlinks
First create a new directory:
```bash
$ mkdir ~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals
$ cd ~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals

```
--

`ln` is short for "__l__i__n__k" <br>
`-s` option for a __s__ymbolic link (i.e. a shortcut).

```bash
$ ln -s ~/BareBonesBash/ERR2020601.fastq.gz .
$ ls
```
```
ERR2020601.fastq.gz
```
???
Make sure you include the `.` in the `ln `command! 

---

# How do I know that is a symlink and not a file?

Option `-l` for `ls`. Gives "__l__ong" information.

```bash
$ ls -l
``` 
```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 thiseas teaching 19 Nov 16 19:52 ERR2020601.fastq.gz ->
~/BareBonesBash/ERR2020601.fastq.gz
```

???
This tells us that the symmlink ERR2020601.fastq.gz POINTS to ~/BareBonesBash/ERR2020601.fastq.gz

--

<br>

--------

<br>

You can use the symlink just like the orginal file!
```bash
$ zcat ERR2020601.fastq.gz | head -n 20 | tail -n 4

```
???
The command looks the same since we kept the file name, but it uses the symlink in the ~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals directory, instead of the orginal file.

- `nano` is a text editor
  - Similar to `TextMate`, `gedit` or `notepad`
  - But runs in your terminal
  - Main difference: how you 'save', 'close' etc.
  - These are controlled with special key combinations 
      - e.g. ctrl + c to copy text in word


---

# Lets do eet!

So open up the program with

```bash
$ nano
```
--

- Try typing something!
- Look at the bottom of the window
  - These correspond to different commands (save, exit, etc.)
  - `^` corresponds to your `ctrl` or `cmd` keys on your keyboard

- Move around with your arrow keys.

--

- To save the contents of your file
  1. Initiate exit with `ctrl + x`
  2. You will be prompted to 'Save modified buffer'.
  3. Press `y` on your keyboard to agree
  4. Set the file name as `~/BareBonesBash/Ftp.Link.txt`
  5. Press `enter` to save

All done!

---

# Not ANOTHER typo!?

Check that the file was successfully generated.

```bash
$ cd ~/BareBonesBash/
$ ls

```
--

Great! There is a file there! But OH NO! We want to have multiple _links_ not a Link!

# Enough pizza, back to mammoths!

- Our loop:
  - For a given list of files
  - Do a symbolic link command for each one
  - Stop when there are no more files

--

```bash
$ for fastq in ERR2020609.fastq.gz ERR2020611.fastq.gz ERR2020567.fastq.gz ERR2020565.fastq.gz ERR2020613.fastq.gz ERR2020618.fastq.gz ERR2020617.fastq.gz; do 
>    ln -s ~/BareBonesBash/$fastq ~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals
> done
```
???
Notice how the prompt changes from `$` to `>`. This means that your command still expects more to be complete. in this case it is completed when `done` is encountered.
--

**Bonus tip time!** `ls` will also accept a path to look into!

```bash
$ ls -l FastQ.Portals/

```

--

```
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 james james 47 Nov 16 16:25 ERR2020565.fastq.gz -> /home/james/BareBonesBash/ERR2020565.fastq.gz

## Hold up...!

We're meant to be lazy! Not writing the name of each FASTQ file!

--

Instead we can use **wildcards** 
 - "refers to a character that can be substituted for zero or more characters in a string". 
 - In bash, the wildcard character is the asterisk (`*`) 
.small[_\[Not to be confused with Asterix, James!)]_].

</p>

In the context of a loop, `*` tells bash to perform an action on all items in
a directory!

--

```bash
$ for fastq in ~/BareBonesBash/*; do
>    ln -s $fastq ~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals
> done

```
--

Don't want literally everything? Then specify all files beginning with ERR!

```bash
$ for fastq in ~/BareBonesBash/ERR*; do
>    ln -s $fastq ~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals
> done

```

???

In the context of a loop, a wildcard tells bash the loop to perform an action on ALL items in a directory, that match the given criterion. 

If we want to create a symlink (with `ln -s`) for every item within the 
`~/BareBonesBash` directory, and place that symlink within the 
`~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals` directory, we could use: 

---

# Combine with everything!

A wildcard can be added anywhere! 

Making the computer to do the hard work for you.

```bash
$ for fastq in ~/BareBonesBash/ERR*.gz; do

# Over to you

Look inside `~/BareBonesBash/FastQ.Portals`
  - Are only your FASTQ files inside?

--

**Try writing your own loop using `for`, `*`, and `rm` to remove ONLY the non-FASTQ files!**


???

If you need to be more specific with your loop, you can also use the wildcard
with some other characters. 

For example, `ERR*` would mean perform a command on every file that begins with 
ERR, regardless of what comes after ERR. 

Finally, we can use characters AFTER the wildcard as well, to only pick up 
files that have a certain suffix as well as prefix (e.g. `ERR*.gz` will find 
all files that begin with `ERR` and end with `.gz`, regardless of what (if 
anything) comes between the two).


As a final practice, have a look inside your `~/FastQ.Portals` directory. 

You might notice that you have also symlinks to `FastQ.Portals` and `Ftp.Links.txt`
as well as our FastQ files. 

These came in our previous `ln -s` loop, as we 
used the wildcard for _everything_ in `~/BareBonesBash`.
