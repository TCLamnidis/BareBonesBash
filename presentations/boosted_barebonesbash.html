# Always mind the `$` and `>`!

</p>

**H/W Fdbk:** When _sharing_ code, don't include the `$` or `>`! makes it harder for others to run! 

To write multi-line code in one: replace a newline with a `;`

???
in Bash ALWAYS MIND THE $. Only copy after the $ so you dont paste the command prompt too. $ is also important when dealing with variables, which you will see later today.

???
Remember we want to be lazy and efficient. While it is sometimes more 'readable', you don't need to cat every file into every program. Almost all programs accept a file by default.

The latter means 1) less typing and 2) less computational resources

.left-column[

- ALWAYS include a 'target' directory when using `ln -s` (even if just `.`). 
  - This is more readable, and less error prone!

- To select all lines _not_ matching a pattern, can use the grep flag `-v` (no need to `diff`! But good find!)

- Comments
  - Comment **step by step**! 
  - Better: **why** something is done, rather than _what_ it accomplishes. 
  - Helps others (such as your baffled bioinformaticians) and **yourself** in two years.

???
i.e. Nicely written code should be self explanatory as to 'how', but 'why' is more useful.

  - Could also use `~/`
  - Could use absolute path e.g. `/home/james/`

# How do I save my stuff?

How to save the output that is normally printed to screen? <img align='middle' title="https://giphy.com/gifs/transparent-nWGRHBnAl5Kmc
" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/nWGRHBnAl5Kmc/giphy.gif" width="10%">

--

```bash
$ find abba_dancing_queen_1976/ -name '*JPG*' -type f > photo_filepaths.txt
```

You use the _redirect_ symbol (`>`) to say take the output of a command and 
place it into the contents of a file.

--

Check you saved correctly!

```bash
$ cat photo_filepaths.txt
```

---
# Concept: Datastreams
Programs can take in and spit out data from different _streams_. By default there are 3 such data streams.
--
.left-column[

- `stdin`: the __st__an__d__ard __in__put
- `stdout`: the __st__an__d__ard __out__put
- `stderr`: the __st__an__d__ard __err__or
]
???
stderr is what is usually printed on your screen, while stout is generally what ends up in output files.
--
.right.column[
<p align="center">
  <img src=".images/Datastreams.png" width="50%">
</p>]
???
In the background, each program also broadcasts an `exit code` which tells you if the program encountered errors. You will never see these in the wild, but it's good to know they exist.
--

.left-column[
<br><br><br>___A program is like the human body; One way in, two ways out!___
]
.right-column[<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/4kg8IIClzvLtC/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/4kg8IIClzvLtC/" width="40%">
</p>]
???
In this analogy exit codes would be how the person is _feeling_, I suppose.

---
# Pipes revisited
In the first session you learned about piping. Here's how that works!
<br>
<br>
--

<p>
  <img src=".images/Piping.png" width="100%">
</p>
<br>
<br>
The `stdout` of one script becomes the `stdin` of the other. 
`stderr` is printed on your screen.

---
# Concept: Redirects

Much like streams in the real world, datastreams can be redirected. 

???
This way you can save the stdout of a program (or even the stderr) into a file to save for later.

--

- `stdin` can be redirected with `<`.

???
An arrow pointing TO your program name!

--

- `stdout` can be redirected with `>`.

???
An arrow pointing AWAY your program name!

--

- `stderr` can be redirected with `2>`.

???
Because it is the secondary output stream.

--

It is also possible to combine streams, but we won't get into that here.
<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72EWUgbRNfLegO1W/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72EWUgbRNfLegO1W/" width="80%">
</p>

---
# Concept: Quotes matter!
In bash, there is a big difference between a single quote `'` and a double quote `"`!

 - The contents of single quotes, are passed on as they are.
 - Inside double quotes, contents are _interpreted_!

???
That means that it will be read just like the rest of the code.

You can already see from the syntax highlighting that $Arr is treated differently in the two quotes.

# While loop: to infinity and beyond!
 - For loops are finate, they go throw your list and stop
 - A while loop keeps going until the statement is false
```bash
while [statment]; do     #means while statement is true do
[whatever you want to do]
done
```
--
An easy example:

.left-column[
```bash
n = 3
while n > 0; do
echo $n
n = $n -1
done
```
]
.right-column[
```
$ 3
$ 2

# Renaming files with piping (shit-cleaning)

**Step one**: check what `rev` does

```bash
$ while read line; do
>   echo $line | rev
> done < photo_filepaths.txt

```
--
**Step two**: check what `cut` does (`-d`elimiter, `-f`ield)

```bash
$ while read line; do
>   echo $line | cut -d . -f 1
> done < photo_filepaths.txt

```
--
**Step three**: Combine! Reverse, then cut second to 'last' number and re-reverse

# Concept: Parameter expansion

What is this magic!?

In the previous example, you used `$()` to only keep the parts of the contents of variable `line`. 
```bash
$ while read line; do
>   new_name="$(echo $line | rev | cut -d . -f 2-9999 | rev)"
>   mv "$line" "$new_name"
> done < photo_filepaths.txt
```
???
This is code is quite explicit. Too much typing for the **truly lazy**!

--

We can make it shorter and better with **parameter expansion** (the magic).

???
Remember how we were saying a variable is like an box that you can put anything inside? Parameter expansion lets you play around with the contents of a the box AS you open it. 

--

Imagine if you got a box of coal for christmas. Then as you open it, you turn the coal into diamonds. Pretty handy!

# The basics

Here's our example variables:
```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ bar="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB_is_bae.txt"
```
???
Two absolute file paths to some imaginary files.

--

To expand a variable use `${}`.
```bash
$ echo ${foo}
```
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
```
???
This is actually what bash does behind the scenes when we type $Var thus far.
--

You can also add a **parameter** to expansions:
```bash
$ echo ${foo#/home/} 
$ echo ${foo#*/}
```
```
thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt

```
???
The first command strips the text after the # from the START of the variable.

You can also use wildcards to make more general expansions.

---

# Some parameters for expansion

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${foo}    # No parameters in this expansion
$ echo ${foo#*/} # Removes everything before the first '/'
$ echo ${foo%.*} # What will this do?
```
--
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
      thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae
```
???
Bash will look for the provided pattern ONCE and remove it.

There are more `.` and `/` but they are not removed.
--

These expansion can be generalised:
```bash
$ echo ${foo##*/} # Removes everything before any '/'
$ echo ${foo%%.*} # Removes everything after any '.'
```
--
```
BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB
```
???
When the parameter is given twice, bash will keep searching for the pattern until it can no longer find it.

---
# More parameters for expansion

You can use two `/` to substitute parts of the variable:
```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${foo}                    # No parameters
$ echo ${foo/BBB/BareBonesBash}  # Change BBB to BareBonesBash
```
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BareBonesBash.is.bae.txt
```
--

Leaving the second `/` out replaces the pattern with "an empty string".
```bash
$ echo ${foo/BBB}  # Remove BBB
```
???
That is programmer speak for "nothing". i.e. it removes the pattern.
--
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/.is.bae.txt
```

---
# The last parameter, I swear!

Finally, you can check the length of a variable by using a `#` BEFORE the variable name.
```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${#foo}  # The length of the variable contents
```
--
```
45
```
So the filepath in `foo` is 45 characters long!

--

This parameter is more useful when dealing with **bash arrays** (i.e. lists of things).

# Renaming files with piping (renaming shit)

Now, as well as being lazy, we are (I am) all ultimately a little narcissistic.

</p>

--

We like things to look **pretty**: convention on file types is they are in lowercase. i.e.

```bash
## DCIM2349817.JPG -> DCIM2349817.jpg
```
--
Consistency generally makes things more **readable** and easier for others to understand your code.

# Renaming files with piping (renaming shit)


So, to prettify in the ultimate laziness, here comes a 'one liner':

--


```bash
$ find abba_dancing_queen_1976/ -name '*JPG*' -type f | rename 's/.JPG/.jpg/'
```

Explanation:
1. Find the files we want to rename
2. Pipe into `rename`
3. Use a _regular expression_ to search and replace in the file name

> As we are piping, `rename` automatically expects filenames, as that is what it does. **This is not universal behaviour**.

# Concept: Regular expressions
- Strings that define a seach pattern
- Used in 'Search' or 'Search/Replace' functions
- You have already used them!
---
# Regex Basics
- . : match any character

--

- []: match range of characters with in []
- [^]: match range of characters except the ones in the bracket
- *: match 0 or more of the preceding items
- +: match 1 or more of the preceding items
- ?: match 0 or 1 of the preceding items
- \: skip character
- ^: beginning line
- $: end of the line
---

# More `find` stuff

It is possible to run more complex commands that require multiple parameters with `find` (and without pipes).

--

Firstly, lets makes project directories that make more sense

```bash
$ mkdir project_photos
$ cd project_photos
$ mkdir Aquitaine Midi-Pyrénées Auvergne
```

--

Secondly, lets retrieve the `.jpg`s from the musical pinnacle of the 1970s 

For this we use `find`'s `-exec` parameter.

```bash
$ find ../abba_dancing_queen_1976 -name '*.jpg' -type f -exec mv {} . \;
```

--

Explanation: 

1. `-exec` to indicate we want to run a command on a `find` result
2. Indicate the result file with `{}` (which we want to move)
3. Indicate the _second_ parameter (in this case, 'here' with `.`)
4. Indicate to `-exec` we are finished with `\;` 

```bash
ls -l ## To check the `.jpg`s are now with you in `project_photos/`
```

---
# Bringing our your broom: If/Else statements

**IDEA NOT ACTUAL CONTENT AIDA TO EXPAND**

_Moving stuff based on ranges into the directory folders something like_

```bash
for file in *.jpg; do
  id=$(echo "$line" | sed -e s/DCIM// -e s/.jpg//)
  if [[ $id -e ${2014971..2349818} ]]; then
    mv "$line" Aquitaine/
  elif [[ $id -e ${2817001..2840541,2921010..2932765} ]]; then
    mv "$line" Midi-Pyrénées/
  else; then
    mv "$line" Auvergne
fi
```

The codes are _id in data.csv and corresponds to column BG (stateProvince)

# sed

Maybe edit the metadata in a simple way. Scapula -> Shoulderblade. Same meaning so it will not confuse people much. 

---
# awk

Extract some specific columns from the metadata. To trim down the table. 

---
# paste

Paste new metadata table with paths from file to make new metadata table.
